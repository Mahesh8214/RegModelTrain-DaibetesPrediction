# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on a set of parameters. It utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically regression models, to analyze and predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing information about patients, including various health parameters. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the regression model.

## Features
- **Patient Parameters:**
  - Include a list of the parameters used for prediction (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age, etc.).

## Project Structure
- **`data/`:**
  - Contains the dataset used for training and testing.

- **`notebooks/`:**
  - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

- **`src/`:**
  - Source code for the regression model and any additional scripts.

- **`results/`:**
  - Store model outputs, visualizations, and evaluation results.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone 

## run cmd pip install -r requirement.txt
